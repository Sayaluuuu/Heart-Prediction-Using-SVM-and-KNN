# Heart-Prediction-Using-SVM-and-KNN
In this project, I used two machine learning models—SVM and KNN—for heart disease prediction.
Initially, the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 70%, which is considered average. However, after applying hyperparameter tuning, the accuracy improved significantly to 85%, which is commendable.
For the KNN model, the initial accuracy was around 65%, and after hyperparameter tuning, it increased to approximately 77%.
